This is my small attempt to make a fully functional API server for a browser / app game taking place in space. 

It serves two purposes â€“ be a fun side project and help practice Go.

There is still a long way to go, but basic elements are already there. I have a lot of documentation and notes as to how I envisage the universe working and might publish them if there are people interested in helping with it :smile:

Most of the low level mechanics are covered with tests but more are definitely needed.
