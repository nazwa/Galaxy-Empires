This is my small attempt to make a fully functional API server for a browser / app game taking place in space. 

It serves two purposes â€“ be a fun side project and help practice Go.

There is still a long way to go, but basic elements are already there. I have a lot of documentation and notes as to how I envisage the universe working and might publish them if there are people interested in helping with it :smile:

Most of the low level mechanics are covered with tests but more are definitely needed.

There is no database integration just yet, as I wanted to keep it as simple as possible for now, so everything is stored in memory. There is also no config file as such, meaning the auth key and server config are hardcoded (who cares, this is not live code, and if it ever becomes they can be easily removed).
